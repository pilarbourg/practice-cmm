          <p class="dark-p"><strong>CEU Mass Mediator</strong> (CMM) is a tool intended for the search of metabolites in
            different
            databases (Kegg, HMDB, LipidMaps, Metlin,
            NP Atlas, KNApSAcK, MINE and an in-house library). It is specifically designed for searches based on
            experimental
            masses obtained from mass spectrometry techniques. CMM unifies compounds from different sources based on the
            InChI Key.
            This allows researchers to save time by avoiding having to find the compounds in the databases one by one
            and unifying them manually,
            as well as reducing the risk of an incorrect manual unification.</p>

          <h1 class="light-heading">CE-MS Services</h1>
          <p class="light-p">The <strong>CE-MS services</strong> allow the search of compounds using experimental
            information from
            Capillary Electrophoresis in different set-ups (background electrolyte, polarity and ionization mode). It
            permits searches using the
            effective mobility, the experimental relative migration time and the predicted absolute or relative
            migration time. Furthermore, it offers the following services:
            1. A Lipid Annotation Service (LAS) for annotating lipids using a totally isolated docker implemented in
            Prolog and applying the same rules than the LC-MS batch advanced search.
            2. A pathway displayer for sorting the most relevant pathways in a previous search from CMM.
            3. Identification of oxidized glycerophosphocholines (oxPCs) based on the MS/MS spectrum of them.
            4. A spectral quality controller to measure the reliability of a spectrum for identification purposes.</p>

          <h1 class="dark-heading"">LC-MS Batch Advanced Search</h1>
          <p class=" dark-p">The <strong>LC-MS batch advanced search</strong> calculates a scoring for the annotations
            based on three
            aspects:
            1. Probability of the compound to form a specific adduct.
            2. Presence of other adducts coming from the same signal in the same RT window.
            3. RT of the lipids with the same head depending on the number of carbons and double bonds (and,
            consequently, the hydrophobicity of them).
            A final score is calculated based on these three aspects (see manual for more information).</p>
